      <li>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?:
        I wanted a better looking portfolio, so that's what I asked for! I already had my images and projects ready to go!</li>

      <li>How did you communicate with your developer? Were there any issues with communication?: 
        We communicated through email, and on occasion would speak to each other in class.</li>

      <li>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?:
        I have no idea yet! I'm still waiting for a response from him. However, I'm sure he did just fine.</li>

      <li>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?:
        I will request that they update me with images of the project every week.</li>

      <li>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?:
        We only communcated through email. I never actually met any of them in real life. (I'm told this is normal??)</li>

      <li>How did you communicate with your client? Were there any issues?: 
        We also communicated through email. But we had two classes together, so I would update him them too when I made changes.</li>

      <li>How did you handle publishing your clientâ€™s site and sharing it with them?:
        Once I updated everything in GitHub, I just sent him a quick email so he could check it out for himself. </li>

      <li>How was your experience managing the site with GitHub?
        I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of GitHub, but it was an interesting experiencce for sure.</li>

      <li>How did you communicate with your team lead? Were there any issues?:
        Communication was a huge issue. Both groups never communicated with me, and one decided to move on without me and do my page for me. It was extremely frustrating.</li>

      <li>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?:
        Not really. Like I said, communication was a huge issue. The page I did do, followed the website plan exactly(Tried at least). I didn't do anything else.</li>

      <li>Were you able to contribute to your sites?:
        Only one site. Like I said, one group didn't wait for me.</li>

      <li>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?:
        I had a LOT of issues with the css. I could never get it right for some reason.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?:
        Communicate, and getting my pages done on time. I was sadly not able to overcome either of these problems.</li>

      <li>What did you enjoy most about this project?:
        Getting to see the creativity of others!</li>

      <li>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?:
        I would communicate often with my team, and get my pages done in a timely manner.
